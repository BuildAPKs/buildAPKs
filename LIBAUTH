Change to the first line to true in order to have BuildAPKs use aritificats and libraries during the build process;  BuildAPKs loads libraries from directories that are located in:

$RDR/var/cache/lib 
$JDR/../lib*
$JDR/lib*
/system 

You can populate the $RDR/var/cache/lib directory from the https://mvnrepository.com website.  For example, this link https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.appcompat/appcompat has appcompat libraries that you can download into BuildAPKs/var/cache/lib for inclusion in the build process.
