>&#13;  Contains variable data like system logging files, mail and printer
  spool directories, and transient and temporary files.
  Some portions of /var are not shareable between different systems. For
  instance, /var/log, /var/lock, and /var/run. Other portions may be shared,
  notably /var/mail, /var/cache/man, /var/cache/fonts, and /var/spool/news.
  Why not put it into /usr? Because there might
  be circumstances when you may want to mount /usr as read-only, e.g. if it is
  on a CD or on another computer. '/var' contains variable data, i.e.
  files and directories the system must be able to write to during operation,
  whereas /usr should only contain static data. Some directories can
  be put onto separate partitions or systems, e.g. for easier backups, due to
  network topology or security concerns. Other directories have to be on the
  root partition, because they are vital for the boot process.
  'Mountable' directories are: '/home', '/mnt',
  '/tmp', '/usr' and '/var'. Essential for booting
  are: '/bin', '/boot', '/dev', '/etc',
  '/lib', '/proc' and '/sbin'.

>&#13;If /var cannot be made a separate partition, it is often preferable to move /
var out of the root partition and into the /usr partition. (This is sometimes
done to reduce the size of the root partition or when space runs low in the
root partition.) However, /var must not be linked to /usr because this makes
separation of /usr and /var more difficult and is likely to create a naming
conflict. Instead, link /var to /usr/var.
  
Applications must generally not add directories to the top level of /var. Such
directories should only be added if they have some system-wide implication, and
in consultation with the FHS mailing list.

  pages is usually stored in /usr/share/man/; some manual pages might come
  with a pre-formatted version, which is stored in /usr/share/man/cat* (this
  is fairly rare now). Other manual pages need to be formatted when they are
  first viewed; the formatted version is then stored in /var/man so that the
  next person to view the same page won't have to wait for it to be
  formatted (/var/catman is often cleaned in the same way temporary
  directories are cleaned).</P

  variable data relating to games in /usr is placed here. It holds variable
  data that was previously found in /usr. Static data, such as help text,
  level descriptions, and so on, remains elsewhere though, such as in
  /usr/share/games. The separation of /var/games and /var/lib as in release
  FSSTND 1.2 allows local control of backup strategies, permissions, and disk
  usage, as well as allowing inter-host sharing and reducing clutter in
  /var/lib. Additionally, /var/games is the path traditionally used by BSD.</P

><DT
>/var/lib</DT
><DD
><P
>Holds
  dynamic data libraries/files like the rpm/dpkg database and game scores.
  Furthermore, this hierarchy holds state information pertaining to an
  application or the system. State information is data that programs modify
  while they run, and that pertains to one specific host. Users shouldn't
  ever need to modify files in /var/lib to configure a package's
  operation. State information is generally used to preserve the condition of
  an application (or a group of inter-related applications) between
  invocations and between different instances of the same application. An
  application (or a group of inter-related applications) use a subdirectory of
  /var/lib for their data. There is one subdirectory, /var/lib/misc, which is
  intended for state files that don't need a subdirectory; the other
  subdirectories should only be present if the application in question is
  included in the distribution. /var/lib/'name' is the location that
  must be used for all distribution packaging support. Different distributions
  may use different names, of course.</P

>/var/local</DT
><DD
><P
>Variable
  data for local programs (i.e., programs that have been installed by the
  system administrator) that are installed in /usr/local (as opposed to a
  remotely mounted '/var' partition). Note that even locally installed
  programs should use the other /var directories if they are appropriate,
  e.g., /var/lock.</P
></DD
><DT
>/var/lock</DT
><DD
><P
>Many
  programs follow a convention to create a lock file in /var/lock to indicate
  that they are using a particular device or file. This directory holds those
  lock files (for some devices) and hopefully other programs will notice the
  lock file and won't attempt to use the device or file.</P
><P
>Lock
  files should be stored within the /var/lock directory structure. Lock files
  for devices and other resources shared by multiple applications, such as the
  serial device lock files that were originally found in either
  /usr/spool/locks or /usr/spool/uucp, must now be stored in /var/lock. The
  naming convention which must be used is LCK.. followed by the base name of
  the device file. For example, to lock /dev/ttyS0 the file LCK..ttyS0 would
  be created. The format used for the contents of such lock files must be the
  HDB UUCP lock file format. The HDB format is to store the process identifier
  (PID) as a ten byte ASCII decimal number, with a trailing newline. For
  example, if process 1230 holds a lock file, it would contain the eleven
  characters: space, space, space, space, space, space, one, two, three, zero,
  and newline.</P

>Log
  files from the system and various programs/services, especially login
  (/var/log/wtmp, which logs all logins and logouts into the system) and
  syslog (/var/log/messages, where all kernel and system program message are
  usually stored). Files in /var/log can often grow indefinitely, and may
  require cleaning at regular intervals. Something that is now normally
  managed via log rotation utilities such as 'logrotate'. This utility
  also allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
  log files. Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly
  or when the log file gets to a certain size. Normally, logrotate runs as a
  daily cron job. This is a good place to start troubleshooting general
  technical problems.</P

  was to bring the FHS inline with nearly every UNIX implementation (it was
