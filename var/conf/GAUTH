The first line of this file is intentionally left blank.  Insert an OAuth username token pair in the first line of this file to enable OAuth authentication, i.e. user:token  As the `build.github.*.bash` scripts may stall for unauthenticated users of GitHub, enabling OAuth increases the rate limit for authenticated GitHub users.

You can use https://github.com/settings/tokens to create an OAuth token.  Information about authentication can be viewed at this https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication address.  

This command ` grep -C 4 -hr AUT ~/buildAPKs/scripts/ ` shows how and where the user token combination is used in the buildAPKs scripts to access the increased rate limit for authenticated GitHub users.  

If there is a "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge" message after ` git pull ` a solution is ` mkdir ~/buildAPKs/stash ; mv ~/buildAPKs/var/config/GAUTH ~/buildAPKs/stash/GAUTH ` to clear this message.
