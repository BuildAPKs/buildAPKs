The first line of this file is intentionally left blank.  Insert an OAuth username token pair in the first line of this file to enable OAuth authentication, i.e. user:token  As the ` build.github*.bash ` scripts can stall for unauthenticated users of GitHub due to the high bandwith they consume when conducting multiple queries.  Enabling OAuth authentication increases the rate limit for authenticated GitHub users.

This https://github.com/settings/tokens link creates OAuth tokens easily.  Information about GitHub authentication can be viewed at this https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication address.  

This command ` grep -C 4 -hr AUT ~/buildAPKs/scripts/ ` shows how the user token combination is used in the buildAPKs scripts to access the increased rate limit for authenticated GitHub users.  

If there is a "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge" message after ` update.buildAPKs.sh ` a solution is ` mv ~/buildAPKs/.config/GAUTH ~/buildAPKs/stash/GAUTH ` to clear this message.  Add a user:token pair again to the new GAUTH file after updating this file.
