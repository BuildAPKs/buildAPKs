The first line of this file is intentionally left blank.  Insert an OAuth username token pair in the first line of this file to enable OAuth authentication, i.e. user:token  As the ` build.github*.bash ` scripts can stall for unauthenticated users of GitHub due to the high bandwith they consume when conducting multiple queries.  Enabling OAuth authentication increases the rate limit for authenticated GitHub users.

This link https://github.com/settings/tokens creates OAuth tokens easily.  Information about GitHub authentication can be viewed at this address https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication at GitHub.  

This command ` grep -C 4 -hr AUT ~/buildAPKs/scripts/ ` shows how the user token combination is used in the buildAPKs scripts to access the increased rate limit for authenticated GitHub users.  

If there is a "stash them before you merge" message after running ` update.buildAPKs.sh ` a solution is ` mv ~/buildAPKs/[items] ~/buildAPKs/stash/ ` to clear the message and update.  You can compare the changes after updating with ` diff ~/buildAPKs/[items] ~/buildAPKs/stash/[items] `.

If there is a "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge" message after running ` update.buildAPKs.sh ` a solution is ` mv ~/buildAPKs/.config/GAUTH ~/buildAPKs/stash/GAUTH ` to clear the message.  Add a user:token pair again to the new GAUTH file after updating this file.
